Calendar Page: 
* Displays Proper Months
* Add one event
* Add multiple events
* Add events on different months
* Delete events
* Calendar page reload
* Improper Time format (time should be TT:MM AM/PM or am/pm
   * Letters 
   * Not correct format(no space between time and am/pm
   * Hour < 12  or min < 59  or both
   * No time 
* Add Tasks 
   * Make sure the days corresponds to the correct task
* Add Hobbies
   * Make sure the amount of hobbies corresponds to the number chosen
   * Make sure the hobby is in the dedicated box (left- morning up to 11 am, middle 12 - 5 pm, right - 6-11:59 pm  
   * Add a hobby of 1 hr  before a task  in the morning/after/evening at 3:32 PM -4:44 PM (output: hobby should appear before  the tasks in morning/afternoon/evening)
   * Multiple before hobbies should always come before tasks 
   * Add a hobby of 1 hr - should appear after tasks in morning/afternoon/evening. If the task time goes past say 12 PM or 6PM into another category, it should instead append that hobby to the very end of the evening category. If there are to many hobbies append to evening by default the planner will remove that task 
   * Between task: add one hobby between each task. If the hobbies max time breaching the difference between the required task before and after it, it will append it to the evening list by default. Test this for tasks with multiple gaps between each to see if the hobbies will go between 














   * Time conflicts(Make sure there’s a fresh terminal if you rerun program) 


      * Test End Conflicts  for ( 6:00 AM - 7:00 AM )you might have to test the correct add to planner cases in multiple runs as if you do them all same run, there will be a conflict, we’re just making sure the tasks are properly adding- Do the error cases first
      *  Test 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM (output: adds to planner)
      * Test 5:00 AM- 6:30 AM ( output: should give error - start before another and end equal to start, but minute is greater than anothers minute) 
      * Test 5:00 AM - 8:00 AM(output: should give error - start before another and end after anothers end)
      * Test 5:00 AM- 7:00 AM(output: should give error - start before another and end equal the another end) 
      * Test End Conflicts  for ( 6:34 AM - 7:00 AM )-you might have to test the correct add to planner cases in multiple runs as if you do them all same run, there will be a conflict, we’re just making sure the tasks are properly adding
      * Test 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM (output: adds to planner)

      * Test 5:00 AM- 7:00 AM(output: should give error - start before another and end equal the another end) 
   * Test End Conflicts  for ( 12:34 PM- 7:31 PM )-you might have to test the correct add to planner cases in multiple runs as if you do them all same run, there will be a conflict, we’re just making sure the tasks are properly adding
      * Test 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM (output: adds to planner)
