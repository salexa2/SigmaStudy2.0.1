I wouldn't serve this as like an insultI don't taste no earpiece girlthis is a No-Nowhat's up you guys my name is Bradley higuys my name is Johanna Mallory what'sgoing on folks it's l Banks of Bostonand today we're going to be trying eachother's Haitian spaghetti you can eatthose Haitian spaghetti any time of theday but typically we eat this forbreakfast Haitian spaghetti is veryunique it's mostly oil sausage I feellike the difference between Italian andHaitian spaghetti is really the spicesfirst things first the base is a pieceonce you have that eight piece it justchanges the game peppers and Scotchbonnets it's actually really good Ithink that's what differentiates youknow Haitian spaghetti with Italian andjust the love the different spices thatwe put in there it's just a Vibe youhave to try it[Music]goodso my family is from Porter Prince HaitiI actually went one time but it was on acruise so it doesn't really count justbecause I haven't been exactly to Haitiit's not going to affect my spaghetti atall because my mom just always made itlike when I was little I would say likesomewhat my aunt taught me how to makethis version of spaghetti so I startedlike mimicking her recipe and that'swhat I brought here today I boiled thepasta put the sausage in the pot I havered peppers yellow peppers and I believeorange Peppers then I added my jerkseasoning in it then I put the tomatopasteno I'll use that piece what makes myspaghetti the best is because it's sospicy like the spice takes over kind ofthe flavor but I love it because I justlove spicy stuff a Haitian if they wereto taste my spaghetti they woulddefinitely sayI've been cooking for a long time so Iknow no I've mastered this recipe it's along time I also like a yearthank you[Music]this one looks nice no I'm lying itdoesn't really look too appetizing I'mnot getting a waftsmells when you make these type ofdishes especially with Haitian food orCaribbean food you want to smell it inthe crib you know what I'm saying itlooks burnt a little bit but you knowlips could be deceiving so I'm gonna tryitthe Scotch bonnet I could definitelyfeel the heat I do taste the spicyportion of it I feel like there's morecoming from the cracked black pepperopposed to the Scotch bonnet you knowand I'm not sure I kind of feel like shedidn't use a piece on this it isdefinitely dry I'm not really getting atomato taste the noodles are cooked goodso that's good this person did not useany ketchup at all they only use tomatopaste which is okay but I do kind ofwish that it had some type of ketchup soit had some type of like sweetness to itI need the whole shebang if I'm gonnaeat a plate of spaghetti you got to dome right all right you need your littleeggs you need the avocados you need somebread it's just the Haitian way on ascale of one to ten I would probablyrate this a six and a half this doesn'treally scream we're here it doesn'tscream nothing it doesn't scream Grammyhe doesn't scream awards show there wasno decorations on the plate if you knowHaitian food you know for a fact it's aproduction like for real decorate yourplate this right here is a five actuallywe're gonna do a six and we're gonna eatthis too[Music]that's all we doso my mom actually grew up in go naiveHaiti and my dad grew up inPort-au-Prince I've been to Haitimultiple times Haitian spaghetti wasjust something that we have on theregular honestly my mom taught me how tomake the spaghetti it just contains alot of like hot dogs and parsley bellpeppers and then I use like chickenbouillon which is also called like MagiI also used a piece Scotch bonnet justto add a little heat onto it and then onthe side we also have a boiled egg Ithank my Haitian spaghetti is definitelya slap your mama type of spaghetti Ithink my spaghetti's the best because itwas made with love a lot of my friendsare always like you know you should openyour own Deli I just know it's gonna bethe best[Music]the color could be more vibrant I feelit definitely smells like hot dogssome Haitians they eat it with boiledeggs and some don't I'm the one thatdoesn't like that's weird to me I know Ilove to eat so let's seeyou can taste the hot dog like who putshot or I hear when people put hot dogsin a pasta dish I'm gonna be honest withy'all I can't get over the fact thatthere's hot dogs in there but noHaitians do use it it's just mypreference it's definitely givingimposter syndrome it's not good like itlooks beautiful but when you actuallytaste it it's gross and it's bland toolike there's not much flavor to it so itseems like they actually added tomatopieces along this is a No-No we don'twant that this is giving like I need todip this in like ranch or something youknow the little boards that has thesticks and all this is it came from thatand we don't want that and uh it'sspaghetti there's nothing Haitian aboutthis well vacation about this is therepresentation like with the Bold eggstaste wise no and the Scotch bonnet wasdefinitely just placed there they didn'tcook it with the Scotch bonnet becauseit's not spicy at all I would have addeda little more a piece there's a lot ofmissed opportunities with adding morespice I would actually saute the Scotchbonnet before I put everything else init add some oil some more tomato pastemake it a little more I'm gonna give ita five they did it for the culture theypulled up they did what they had to do Iwould have definitely omit the hot dogsthat's me thing I'll give it a three Iwouldn't serve this to my Haitian familymembers if I gave this to them they'd belike Johanna like what is thisforeign[Music]Haitian food and cooking is definitelyin my blood from my grandmother myauntie and my mother of course my motheris actually a caterer so I grew uphelping her out with her business andthat's one of the dishes that she wouldalways make so today what we have is wehave some sausages because we're notdoing hot dogs our Peach did not comeall the way from Haiti for y'all to justbe doing hot dogs we use the smokedsausages you need a little oil that'sthe way you know it's on point thatlittle lip gloss action yes you knowexactly what I mean the thing that youdo when you're soften up your Haitianbread that oil that slick right therethat's what you need we got some tomatopaste some onions some peppers and ofcourse we had the hard-boiled eggs sopretty much it's star chart Stars we gotour avocados we got our bread and we gotour pasta however if you want to goextra fancy though as you can see wecould add some salad some Watercress andsome onions just to kind of like pretendto be healthy I think what makes myspaghetti the best is really the peopleI have a long long long line of fans forthis specific specific dish for all ofmy pop-ups so the people are talkingit's spicy it's Savory it has Umamiflavors it's just fire that's it that'sjust the bottom line folksforeign[Music]this looks much better already Haitianbread oh I love this I love Haitianbread it smells spicy an avocado I'venever really had spaghetti with avocadosbut kudos to you for trying to behealthy girl these are just sides so noI wouldn't see this on like a typicalHaitian plate like people just played itwith the spaghetti and the boiled eggI like this one I would definitelyfinish this plate it's really good it'sspicy it has lots of flavor the ketchupstands out to me it's not too dry it'snot too thick like actual like spaghettisauce they didn't use hot dogs which Ihate she didn't use sausageshe did I'm disappointed why are youguys using sausage I didn't like the eggit's too undercooked it's too yellow shetried to americanize this a little bit Isee because ain't no way there's noHaitian person putting no paprika ontheir boiled eggs with spaghetti come onyou can this is a Haitian dish it tastesgood it looks good she put the signatureegg has enough spice like whoever madethis really did their thing I wouldchange the sausage because I'm not a fanof sausage in the avocado I mean I seewhat you were doing there but girl no wedon't we don't need all that I'm gonnachange anything about it it's reallygood if I was to rate this from one toten I would give it a eight I definitelydo feel like I'm in a Haitian restaurantwith a presentation really took me bysurprise so good job on that I wouldrate the spaghetti I'll give it a ton Idefinitely want to finish itforeign[Music]love to
