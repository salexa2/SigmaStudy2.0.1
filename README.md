# SigmaStudy

System Overview:

Sigma Study is an innovative app designed to make learning from 
YouTube videos easier and more effective. With Sigma Study, users can simply 
input a YouTube link and get a transcript of the video. They can then summarize 
the transcript for easier learning, or create flashcards to help reinforce what
they have learned. Sigma Study also features a calendar where users can add and 
delete events, as well as a schedule generator that creates a weekly routine based 
on inputted information. With Sigma Study, learning has never been easier or more convenient.
