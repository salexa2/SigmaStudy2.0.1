System Overview:

Please refer to StudySigma for past changes and history. 

Sigma Study is an innovative app designed to make learning from 
YouTube videos easier and more effective. With Sigma Study, users can simply 
input a YouTube link and get a transcript of the video. They can then summarize 
the transcript for easier learning, or create flashcards to help reinforce what
they have learned. Sigma Study also features a calendar where users can add and 
delete events, as well as a schedule generator that creates a weekly routine based 
on inputted information. With Sigma Study, learning has never been easier or more convenient.
